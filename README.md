M480-HW7-Latex-Document
=======================

<b>Create a 2 page LaTeX document. </b> <br>

Create a 2 page LaTeX document that is about your project. Use at least the following features from latex: at least one math formula, lists (\begin{enumerate}/\end{enumerate}), sections (\section), cross references (\label and \ref), and titles (\title, \author, \maketitle). <b>Your solution should be a link to a directory on github that contains at least a .tex file and a .pdf file (so I can easily look at the pdf generated from your tex file without having to tex it myself).</b> IMPORTANT: I will only grade this based on the typesetting, not on the mathematical *content* of your document.
